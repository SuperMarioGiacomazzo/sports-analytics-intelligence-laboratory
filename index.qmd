## History of SAIL

The idea for SAIL was conceived in Fall 2022 when Conor Kerr, advised by Dr. Mario Giacomazzo of the STOR Department, had been working on sports analytics projects with UNC Men's and Women's Basketball for two years. As the work demand increased, the need to expand became clear.

From December 2022 to January 2023, the first SAIL applications were received, and 52 well-deserving undergraduates applied to be Undergraduate Sports Analysts (USAs). With the help of Andrew Ackerman, a PhD student in the STOR department, we selected 5 students to be the first team of USAs.
