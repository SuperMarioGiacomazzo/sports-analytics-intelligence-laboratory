    "text": "History of SAIL\nThe idea for SAIL was conceived in Fall 2022 when Conor Kerr, advised by Dr. Mario Giacomazzo of the STOR Department, had been working on sports analytics projects with UNC Men’s and Women’s Basketball for two years. As the work demand increased, the need to expand became clear.\nFrom December 2022 to January 2023, the first SAIL applications were received, and 52 well-deserving undergraduates applied to be Undergraduate Sports Analysts (USAs). With the help of Andrew Ackerman, a PhD student in the STOR department, we selected 5 students to be the first team of USAs.\n\n\n\nFounding members of SAIL from left to right: Jacob Thoma, Max Sleek, Lewis Dubrowski (top), Sarah Wooster, Conor Kerr, Abigail Mabe (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Growth\n\n\n\nSince our founding, SAIL has grown significantly, now supporting multiple athletic programs and conducting research across various sports disciplines."
